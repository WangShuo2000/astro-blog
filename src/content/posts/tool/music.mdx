**Hi everyone, thanks for reading!**

As someone who listens to music a lot, I spend hours every day enjoying my favorite tunes. On one hand, music helps me focus on my work and improves my productivity. On the other hand, it also helps me relax and unwind after a long day.

In the past, I used QQ Music for a long time because, as a student, I could easily login with my QQ account. It was convenient, and many songs were available without needing a VIP membership. Over time, however, that changed—more and more songs required a VIP subscription. Although the cost wasn't high, I decided to continue using QQ Music, as it seemed natural to do so.

Once I started working, my need for high-quality music became even more important. I began comparing different music platforms and realized I needed a service that offered better audio quality. Naturally, I decided to give Apple Music a try, as it seemed like a convenient option with good quality. I used it for three months, but at the same time, I kept my QQ Music VIP subscription active. Why? Because Apple Music didn’t have as many songs in my preferred genres.

After these experiences, I will determine a platform cautiously. I've been thinking about what factors are most important for me when choosing a music platform, songs amount > songs quality > ui > price. I came across several options, such as Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, and NetEase Cloud Music, and I compared them and summarized a table.

| **Platform**               | **Pros**                                                                                      | **Cons**                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Apple Music**             | - High-quality audio (Lossless and Spatial Audio) <br />- Seamless integration with Apple ecosystem <br />- Extensive music library <br />- Precise personalized recommendations and playlists | - Higher subscription cost, no free version (only a trial) <br />- Cross-platform experience is not as good as on Apple devices <br />- Fewer Chinese-language songs |
| **Spotify**                 | - Strong personalized recommendation algorithm <br />- Extensive cross-platform support <br />- Free version (ad-supported) <br />- Rich global music library          | - Fewer Chinese-language songs <br />- Lower audio quality for free users <br />- Ads interfere with the free experience                              |
| **YouTube Music**           | - Combines video and audio <br />- Good integration with Google ecosystem <br />- Extensive global music library, especially for video content <br />- Free version available | - Ads in the free version <br />- Audio quality is not as good as Apple Music or Spotify <br />- Recommendation algorithm is relatively weak                |
| **NetEase Cloud Music**     | - Rich Chinese music content, especially independent music <br />- Strong social and community features <br />- Good recommendation algorithm <br />- Rich free version features | - Audio quality is not as good as Apple Music's lossless audio <br />- Some international music is unavailable due to copyright restrictions <br />- Ads in the free version        |
| **QQ Music**                | - Huge Chinese music library <br />- Good integration with Tencent's social platforms <br />- Multiple subscription models <br />- Rich MV and concert video resources | - Ads in the free version <br />- Audio quality is not as good as Apple Music <br />- Recommendation algorithm is slightly weaker than other platforms <br/>- People with negative news will be banned                       |

Wish to help you.

It's so easy to decide which is best for me — YouTube Music. Another important factor is that I can subscribe to YouTube Premium, which includes YouTube Music Premium. This is great because it means I can get both services at a lower price.

The last step is comparing price in different regions, I made a table too.
| **Region**     | **Price**        |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Hong Kong**  | **78 HK $**      |
| **America**    | **14 $**         |
| **Japan**      | **1280 JPY**      |

I've compared these three regions, and it's clear that the price in Japan is lower. The region itself isn't important to me. And in this region an annual subscription costs 12,800 JPY, which is even more affordable.

I've been using YouTube Music for a week now, and I'm really satisfied with this platform. It's become an important part of my music playlist, and I enjoy discovering new tracks. Feel free to share your recent music discoveries with me!
