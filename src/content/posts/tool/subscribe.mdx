# Youtube
YouTube Premium is a subscription service that offers an ad-free experience on YouTube, along with
background play, offline downloads, and access to YouTube Music. It enhances the viewing experience by removing interruptions and providing additional features that are particularly useful for frequent users of the platform.
- **Use**<br/>
As a software developer, I often go to YouTube to search for relevant learning resources such as react and nest. At the same time, as a travel enthusiast, I also watch many videos of beautiful scenery. It feels so good to turn on 4k or 8k, such as links' videos. Sometimes I watch some stock and financial bloggers to learn relevant knowledge and analysis.
- **Cost**<br/>
I subscribe to the annual fee, which is about 12800JPY for 13 months, which is about 41RMB per month.

# 1coinVPN
Because the YouTube membership I bought is for the Japanese region, I found a VPN with many nodes for the Japanese region.
1coinvpn (or "One Coin VPN") appears to be a VPN service, likely marketed for its affordability or simple pricing model. VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are designed to provide a secure and private connection over a public network, such as the internet, by encrypting data and masking the user's IP address. This helps to enhance online privacy, bypass geo-restrictions, and improve security when using public Wi-Fi.
- **Use**<br/>
I use it to access foreign websites and apps.
- **Cost**<br/>
I bought the monthly payment, which is about 32 RMB per month

# Google One
Google One is a subscription service from Google that offers expanded cloud storage across Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos, along with additional benefits. These benefits often include access to Google experts, family sharing options, and extra member benefits such as Google Store rewards or discounts on Google Play. It consolidates Google's various storage offerings and adds value for users who need more space or enhanced support.
- **Use**<br/>
For me, this package is worth it. Not only can I use the most powerful and multi-context models in Gemini to assist my daily coding and problems, but I can also use Veo3 to generate 8s dubbed videos. I also use NotebookLM to quickly generate outlines and summaries, as well as podcasts, which is really convenient.
- **Cost**<br/>
It's about 147 RMB per month
