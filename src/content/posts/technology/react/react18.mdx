# Background

As a Vue user, I started to use React for work after I changed companies. This blog will introduce the updated content and core ideas of React 18 from a personal perspective.

# Diving Deep into React 18: Concurrent Features

React 18 introduced significant changes under the hood, primarily focused on enabling *concurrency*. This unlocks powerful new features and performance improvements. Let's explore the core concepts and how they work.

## What is Concurrency in React?

### The Old Way: Synchronous Rendering
Traditionally, React’s rendering process was synchronous. When an update occurred—whether it was a state change, a prop change, or a parent component rerender—React had to complete the entire rendering process before returning control back to the browser. This synchronous approach could often result in a laggy or unresponsive UI, particularly in complex applications or on lower-powered devices.
Imagine a scenario where a user interacts with your web page—perhaps typing in a text field or scrolling through a large list. With synchronous rendering, React would need to complete the entire update before rendering the next UI update, even if the current one was large and unnecessary. This could make the UI feel unresponsive, as React blocked the main thread during rendering.

### The New Way: Concurrent Rendering
React 18 introduces concurrent rendering, which is the key to unlocking the power of concurrency. With concurrent rendering, React can now interrupt its rendering process at any point. This means it can start working on an update, pause it if a more important task comes up (such as a user interaction), and then resume the previous work once the more important task is completed.
In simpler terms, React can now prioritize updates based on urgency. This allows React to handle more time-sensitive tasks like user input (e.g., typing, clicking) without compromising the performance of complex updates (e.g., large lists, complex calculations).
For example, if a user types into a search input while the page is updating a large list, React can prioritize the user’s input, making the search feel instantaneous while it works on updating the list in the background. This results in a smoother, more responsive experience for the user.

## Key Concepts Enabling Concurrency

React 18's concurrency is built upon several key concepts:

*   **Concurrent Rendering:** This is the core mechanism that allows React to interrupt rendering. Instead of a single, uninterrupted rendering pass, React can now work in phases, pausing and resuming as needed.
*   **Interruptible Rendering:** React can now interrupt long-running renders to handle more important updates. This is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience.
*   **Suspense:** Suspense lets components "wait" for something to load (data, code, images) before rendering. It works seamlessly with concurrent rendering, allowing React to pause rendering components that are waiting for data and resume when the data is available.
*   **Transitions:** Transitions provide a way to mark non-urgent UI updates. This tells React that these updates can be interrupted without negatively impacting the user experience. This is especially useful for things like search input filtering or navigating between tabs.

## How it Works Under the Hood

React 18 utilizes a new architecture built around *Fiber*. Fiber represents a unit of work. It allows React to break down updates into smaller chunks and prioritize them.

Here's a simplified view of the process:

1.  **Update Triggered:** An update occurs (e.g., `setState`).
2.  **Work Created:** React creates a tree of Fiber nodes representing the work that needs to be done.
3.  **Scheduling:** React schedules the work based on its priority. Urgent updates (like user input) are given higher priority.
4.  **Rendering (Reconciliation):** React begins rendering the components. With concurrent rendering, this process can be paused and resumed.
5.  **Commit:** Once the rendering is complete (and not interrupted), React commits the changes to the DOM.

## Example: Using Transitions

```jsx
import { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('');
  const [list, setList] = useState([]);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    startTransition(() => {
      setFilter(e.target.value);
      // Simulate a long-running filter operation
      setTimeout(() => {
        setList(performFilter(e.target.value));
      }, 500);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={filter} onChange={handleChange} />
      {isPending && <p>Filtering...</p>} {/* Show a pending indicator */}
      <ul>
        {list.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the startTransition function tells React that the filter update is not urgent. If the user types quickly, React can interrupt the filtering process to keep the input responsive. The isPending state allows us to display a loading indicator during the transition.

Benefits of Concurrency
Improved Responsiveness: By allowing interruptions, React keeps the UI responsive even during complex updates.
Better User Experience: Transitions and Suspense provide smoother transitions and loading experiences.
Enables New Features: Concurrency is the foundation for features like Server Components and Offscreen Rendering.
Conclusion
React 18's concurrent features represent a significant step forward in React's architecture. By understanding the core concepts and how they work, you can unlock the full potential of React and build more performant and user-friendly applications. This is a fundamental shift, and while immediate API changes might be subtle in some cases, the groundwork is laid for future powerful features.
